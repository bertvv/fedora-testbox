# test-linux

A Vagrant configuration for a VirtualBox VM with a minimal installation of Fedora 20, i386 for experimenting and learning Linux.

The VM is based on a base box generated by Packer using a [template forked](https://github.com/bertvv/fedora-vm/tree/local) from [box-cutter/fedora-vm](https://github.com/box-cutter/fedora-vm).

Specifications:

- Use `be-latin1` keyboard layout
- Install updates (during base box creation)
- Guest additions are installed (useful for syncing directories)
- Add user `student` with password `student` and `sudo` capabilities (no password)
- Installs several useful packages (see [ansible/host_vars/testlinux](https://github.com/bertvv/fedora-testbox/blob/master/ansible/host_vars/testlinux) for an overview
- `Nano` has syntax colouring
- Firewall is OFF
- Two network interfaces:
    - NAT
    - Host-only adapter with fixed IP 192.168.56.20
